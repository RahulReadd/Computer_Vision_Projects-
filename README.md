# Computer_Vision_Projects-
Currently I am exploring the field of computer vision. I am uploading the projects I am working upon. 

## Project-1: crack-detection-vgg16.ipynb 
This PS was given in a competetion hosted by IIT Madras on the occasion of their annual techno-management fest Shaastra, that I participated.
### Description - 
Concrete cracking is a major issue in Bridge Engineering. Detection of cracks facilitates the design, construction and maintenance of bridges effectively.
### Requirement Specification:
-> Use open source dataset (From the link: https://cutt.ly/PS_1_dataset)

-> Develop a suitable Deep Learning framework which can detect the crack in the image from the dataset

-> Transfer Learning based DL framework would be appreciated
### Judging Metrics & My Results: 
->Precision = 0.96153

->Recall = 1

->F1 score = 0.98039638602
